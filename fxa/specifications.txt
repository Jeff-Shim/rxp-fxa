File Transfer Application (FxA) 

FxA is a very simple client-server file transfer application. The FxA commands should be as follows: 

FxA SERVER
● Command-line: FxA-server X A P 

The command-line arguments are:
X: the port number at which the FxA-server’s UDP socket should bind to (odd number) 

A: the IP address of NetEmu
P: the UDP port number of NetEmu 

● Command: window W (only for projects that support pipelined and bi- directional transfers) 

W: the maximum receiver’s window-size at the FxA-Server (in segments). 

● Command: terminate Shut-down FxA-Server gracefully. 

FxA CLIENT
● Command-line: FxA-client X A P 

The command-line arguments are: 

X: the port number at which the FxA-client’s UDP socket should bind to (even number). Please remember that this port number should be equal to the server’s port number minus 1. 

A: the IP address of NetEmu
P: the UDP port number of NetEmu 

● Command: connect - The FxA-client connects to the FxA-server (running at the same IP host). 

● Command: get F - The FxA-client downloads file F from the server (if F exists in the same directory with the FxA-server program). 

● Command: post F - The FxA-client uploads file F to the server (if F exists in the same directory with the FxA-client program). This feature will be treated as extra credit for up to 20 project points.

● Command: window W (only for projects that support configurable flow window) W: the maximum receiver’s window-size at the FxA-Client (in segments). 

● Command: disconnect - The FxA-client terminates gracefully from the FxA-server.
